                This application is to be utilized at a veterinarian office. The app stores client and pet information.
                For the client, address and contact information and names of pets are collected. 
                For the pet information, it stores name, type, breed, color, weight, spay/neuter status, and vaccination record. 
                One can view All Owners, all pets by Owner or All Pets. 
                It then produces a record of that pet, which includes all the health information. 
                There are abilities to create, read, update and delete owners and pets.
